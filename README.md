This Java project simulates three common CPU scheduling algorithms: Shortest Job First (SJF), Priority Scheduling, and Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF). It allows users to input multiple processes with details like process name, arrival time, burst time, and priority.it determining which processes run when multiple processes are eligible. The project calculates and displays the waiting time and turnaround time for each process, along with average statistics for all processes. The simulator also includes features like context switching, aging for priority adjustment, and handling process starvation.This project highlights my skills in Java, algorithm design and fundamentals of operating systems.
